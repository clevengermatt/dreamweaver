**Traditions of Kindleglow**

• At sunset, families and communities light enchanted lanterns or candles, filling homes and streets with warm, flickering light.

2. **The Hearth Gathering:**

• Families and friends gather around a hearth or central fire to share stories, sing songs, and reflect on the year’s blessings.

• Acts of kindness, such as helping neighbors or giving to those in need, are especially encouraged on Kindleglow.

4. **The Lantern Procession:**

**Adventurers and Kindleglow**
