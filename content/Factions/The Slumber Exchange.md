**Type:** Opportunistic Information Brokers

**Purpose:** Extracting and Selling Secrets for Waking-World Profit

**Alignment:** Neutral with Self-Serving Tendencies

The Slumber Exchange is a shadowy network of information brokers who operate exclusively within the dream realm. They thrive on exploiting the secrets buried in the subconscious of dreamers, using the dreamscape as a means to generate profit in the waking world. Their sole allegiance is to money, and they will trade secrets to anyone who can pay their price, no matter the consequences.

**Philosophy and Goals**

The Slumber Exchange views the dreamscape not as a mystical realm or sacred space, but as an endless well of profitable information. Their ultimate goal is simple: amass waking-world wealth by trading in dream-extracted secrets.

Despite their unsavory reputation, The Slumber Exchange is ruthlessly efficient, priding itself on delivering high-quality intelligence. They value the dreamscape as their most critical resource, fiercely protecting its usefulness while exploiting its secrets to the fullest.

**Methods and Practices**

The operatives of The Slumber Exchange are skilled dreamwalkers who use subtle techniques to infiltrate dreams, uncover valuable information, and manipulate dreamers for profit.

**Key Practices:**

• **Dream Espionage:** Entering dreams to extract hidden truths, suppressed memories, or subconscious desires.

• **Manipulation:** Planting ideas or stirring emotions in dreamers to influence their decisions in the waking world.

• **Information Trade:** Selling dream-derived intelligence to individuals, corporations, and even criminal organizations in exchange for waking-world cash.

While most of their work relies on individual dreamwalking, their possession of a few stolen dreamcatchers gives them an edge in achieving lucidity, making their operations more efficient and dangerous.

**Relationship with [[[the Dreamweavers Guild**]]]

The Slumber Exchange’s relationship with [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] is tense and begrudging at best. The guild views the Exchange’s practices as a direct affront to its mission to protect dreamers and preserve the balance of the dreamscape.

**Points of Tension:**

• **Ill-Gotten Dreamcatchers:** The Exchange’s stolen [[dreamcatchers]] are a major source of conflict, as these artifacts give them a significant advantage while representing a breach of the guild’s sacred tools.

• **Unethical Practices:** The Exchange’s willingness to sell sensitive information to dangerous buyers clashes with the guild’s moral responsibilities.

• **Reluctant Dependency:** Despite their disdain, the guild sometimes finds itself needing the Exchange’s information to complete missions. This transactional relationship leaves a bitter taste, as the guild despises paying into the Exchange’s questionable practices.

**Organization and Motivation**

The Slumber Exchange operates more like a loose syndicate than a formal organization, with independent operatives working under a shared banner. Their network is vast, ensuring that nearly any secret unearthed in the dreamscape eventually finds its way to one of their brokers.

Their true motivation is money, and nothing more. The dreamscape is merely a tool, a cash cow that funds their waking-world ambitions. They hold no allegiance to dreamers, dreamwalking ethics, or even the dream realm itself, as long as it continues to provide profit.
  
**Significance in the Dream Realm**

The Slumber Exchange is a constant thorn in [[The Dreamweavers Guild]]’s side, a group whose opportunistic nature and lack of ethics make them both a resource and a threat. They embody the dreamscape’s potential for exploitation, wielding it as a tool to serve their greed.

Despite their scummy reputation, The Slumber Exchange’s mastery of the dreamscape ensures that they remain relevant—and necessary—in a world where secrets are the most valuable currency.
