**Type:** Religious Fanatics

**Purpose:** Merging the Dream Realm and the Waking World

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral

The Reverie Convergence is a devoted and fanatical sect operating exclusively within the dreamscape. Their ultimate goal is to merge the dream realm with the waking world, creating what they believe will be a unified, transcendent reality. They revere the [[sand]] as a divine phenomenon and interpret its presence as evidence of the two realms colliding.

**Philosophy and Beliefs**

The Convergence holds that the division between the dream realm and reality is an unnatural flaw, one that they are destined to correct.

• **Dreamscape as the Divine Source:** To the Convergence, the dream realm is sacred, the origin of all truths and possibilities. They believe it is the key to creating a higher existence.

• **[[Sand]] as a Holy Sign:** They view the [[sand]] as a sacred symbol of the veil thinning, a divine marker that their mission is succeeding.

• **Rituals to Thin the Veil:** Members dedicate themselves to ceremonies and actions within the dream realm, which they believe will bring about the merger of worlds. Operating in the waking world is seen as unnecessary; they believe the transformation must begin within the dreamscape.

**Evidence for Their Beliefs**

The Reverie Convergence claims to have evidence supporting their beliefs, though many dismiss it as faith-driven exaggeration. Their “proof” includes:

• **The Appearance of [[Sand]]:** Reports of [[sand]] appearing more frequently and in unnatural places, which they interpret as a sign of the veil weakening.

• **Shared Dream Phenomena:** Stories of dreamers experiencing identical dreams or retaining vivid memories of [[dreams]] shared with others, suggesting a growing overlap between realms.

• **Dream Residue:** Rare accounts of sensations or objects from [[dreams]] briefly lingering after waking, seen as further proof of the realms merging.

**Methods and Activities**

The Convergence operates exclusively in the dream realm, carrying out rituals and disrupting guild efforts that they see as counterproductive to their cause.

• **Ritual Ceremonies:** They conduct elaborate rites designed to thin the veil, often involving symbolic elements like sand or recurring [[Driftways]].

• **Recruitment:** They attract new members by promising transcendence and enlightenment, often preying on disillusioned dreamers and [[Dreamkind]].

• **Interference with [[Driftways]]:** They disrupt [[Driftways]] to destabilize the dreamscape, believing such actions will accelerate the merging of the realms.

**Relationship with Other Factions**

• **[[The Dreamweavers Guild]]:** The guild views the Convergence as dangerous fanatics whose actions threaten the balance of the dream realm and waking world. The Convergence sees the guild as an impediment to their divine mission.

• **[[The Slumber Exchange]]:** The Convergence has little interaction with the Exchange, dismissing them as irreverent profiteers who fail to grasp the dreamscape’s spiritual significance.

• **[[The Nightshade Cartel]]:** While the cartel has no ideological alignment with the Convergence, they occasionally exploit the sect’s actions for their own benefit.

**Reputation and Perception**

To most dreamwalkers and [[Dreamkind]], the Reverie Convergence is a fringe group of misguided zealots. Their rituals and increasing presence in the dreamscape have begun to draw attention, and their actions are seen as destabilizing by both allies and enemies.
