**Type:** Dreamwalking Enthusiasts and Explorers

**Purpose:** Exploration and Study of the Dreamscape

**Alignment:** Neutral Good

The Driftborne Society is a collective of dreamwalkers who dedicate themselves to exploring the dreamscape out of pure curiosity and a love of discovery. Comprised of academics, hobbyists, and adventurers, the Driftborne are passionate about mapping dreams, cataloging [[Driftways]], and unraveling the mysteries of the dream realm.

Unlike [[the Dreamweavers Guild]], the Driftborne have no interest in policing or controlling the dreamscape. Their goals are purely academic, and they are known for their willingness to share information and tips with like-minded individuals.

**Philosophy and Goals**

The Driftborne Society values knowledge and exploration above all else.

• **Dreamscape Exploration:** Members are committed to understanding the dream realm’s structure, phenomena, and unique rules.

• **Knowledge Sharing:** They believe that [[dreamwalking]] is a skill to be celebrated and shared, not hoarded or restricted.

• **Preservation of Wonder:** The Driftborne see the dreamscape as a vast frontier meant to be explored, admired, and respected.

**Structure and Membership**

The society is loosely organized, with no formal hierarchy. Members operate independently or in small groups but often gather to exchange discoveries and techniques.

• **Scholars and Hobbyists:** The Driftborne attract academics, researchers, and those who dreamwalk purely for enjoyment.

• **Informal Gatherings:** They hold occasional meetups in the waking world and sometimes within the dream realm itself, using shared dreamcatchers to convene.

• **Friendly Network:** Membership is open to anyone with a passion for [[dreamwalking]], regardless of background or skill level.

**Activities and Contributions**

The Driftborne Society’s work contributes to the broader understanding of the dreamscape:

• **Mapping and Cataloging:** Members focus on documenting the locations of Driftways, recurring dream patterns, and unique phenomena within the dream realm.

• **Tips and Techniques:** They are a valuable source of practical advice for dreamwalkers, offering guidance on achieving lucidity and navigating challenging dreamscapes.

• **Information Trading:** While they are harmless, the Driftborne often trade information with other groups, including [[the Dreamweavers Guild]] and even [[the Slumber Exchange]], making them an important hub of dreamwalking knowledge.

**Relationship with Other Factions**

• **[[The Dreamweavers Guild]]:** The Driftborne maintain a cordial relationship with the guild, respecting its mission while avoiding involvement in its policing activities. Guild members occasionally consult with the Driftborne for insights into the dreamscape.

• **[[The Slumber Exchange]]:** The Driftborne are wary of [[the Slumber Exchange]]’s profit-driven motives but occasionally trade information when it suits their goals.

• **[[The Nightshade Cartel]]:** The Driftborne avoid the cartel entirely, viewing them as a dangerous and malevolent force within the dream realm.

**Reputation**

The Driftborne Society is known as a harmless and enthusiastic group of dreamwalkers who are more interested in exploration than conflict. Their collective expertise and extensive knowledge of the dreamscape make them valuable allies, even if their focus on discovery sometimes leads them into trouble.
