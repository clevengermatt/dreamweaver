**Type:** Category of Malevolent Entities

**Purpose:** Destruction, Manipulation, and Chaos in the Dream Realm

**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil

The Nightmare Tide is a collective term for the most malevolent and destructive entities within the dreamscape. These beings, ranging from cunning manipulators to primal forces of chaos, thrive on harming dreamers, destabilizing dreams, and spreading fear and destruction. While not a unified organization, the Nightmare Tide represents a shared threat—a dark undercurrent of malevolence that threatens the stability of the dream realm.

**Nature and Types of Entities**

The Nightmare Tide includes a wide spectrum of beings, each adding to the chaos in their own way:

• **Sophisticated Orchestrators:**

These entities are manipulators who craft intricate nightmares, tormenting dreamers or steering them toward ruin in the waking world.

• **Primal Agents of Chaos:**

Mindless and destructive, these forces exist purely to consume and destroy dreamscapes, leaving devastation in their wake.

• **Corrupted [[Dreamkind]]:**

Autonomous [[Dreamkind]] who have embraced darkness and now use their power to terrorize or dominate others in the dreamscape.

• **Demons and Aberrations:**

Interlopers from other planes that intrude upon the dream realm, often feeding on fear, anguish, and psychic energy.

**Motivations and Behavior**

The motivations of Nightmare Tide entities vary:

• **Chaos and Destruction:** Many are driven purely by instinct or malice, thriving on the destruction of [[dreams]] and dreamers.

• **Power and Control:** Some orchestrators seek dominance over sections of the dreamscape, manipulating both dreamers and [[Dreamkind]] for their own ends.

• **Sustenance:** Some feed on emotions such as fear, despair, or rage, using nightmares as a hunting ground.

**Relationships with Other Factions**

• **[[The Dreamweavers Guild]]:** The guild sees the Nightmare Tide as a direct and existential threat to the dreamscape, dedicating considerable resources to identifying and neutralizing them.

• **[[The Slumber Exchange]]:** Most of the Nightmare Tide are too volatile to work with the Slumber Exchange, but certain orchestrators may engage in information trades for mutual benefit.

• **[[The Nightshade Cartel]]:** The cartel is wary of the Nightmare Tide’s unpredictability but has been known to collaborate with sophisticated orchestrators to achieve particularly brutal or manipulative objectives. These alliances are tenuous and often result in collateral damage.

• **[[The Reverie Convergence]]:** The Convergence vehemently opposes the Nightmare Tide, viewing them as blasphemous forces whose chaos jeopardizes the divine merging of realms the Convergence seeks. They often disrupt Nightmare Tide incursions in the dreamscape to protect their sacred mission.

**Impact on the Dreamscape**

The Nightmare Tide’s actions have severe and far-reaching consequences:

• **Collapsed Dreamscapes:** They render parts of the dream realm unstable or uninhabitable.

• **Harmed Dreamers:** Their victims often awaken with severe psychological damage or find themselves trapped in recurring nightmares.

• **Fear and Distrust:** The Tide’s presence fosters paranoia and instability among both dreamers and [[Dreamkind]], making cooperation more difficult.
