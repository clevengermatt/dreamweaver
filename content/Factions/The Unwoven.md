**Type:** [[Dreamkind]] Rebels

**Purpose:** Opposing Dreamwalker Authority and Advocating for [[Dreamkind]] Autonomy

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral

The Unwoven are a minority faction of [[Dreamkind]] united by their resistance to [[the Dreamweavers Guild]] and its presence in the dreamscape. They reject the idea that the dream realm should be monitored or controlled by dreamwalkers, whom they view as outsiders imposing their will on a space that belongs to [[Dreamkind]].

**Philosophy and Goals**

The Unwoven are motivated by a desire for independence and freedom for [[Dreamkind]], particularly autonomous entities.

• **Autonomy for [[Dreamkind]]:** They believe the dream realm should be governed solely by its native inhabitants, free from dreamwalker intervention.

• **Rejection of Policing:** The Unwoven oppose the guild’s efforts to influence or regulate the dreamscape, viewing such actions as oppressive and unnecessary.

• **Preservation of Freedom:** They see the guild’s structure as antithetical to the dreamscape’s natural, fluid existence.

While their ideals resonate with some [[Dreamkind]], the Unwoven remain a minority. Most [[Dreamkind]] either support the guild’s efforts to maintain stability or are indifferent, content to go about their existence without concern for dreamwalker activities.

**Relationship with the Guild**

The Unwoven view [[the Dreamweavers Guild]] as an overbearing force, meddling in the affairs of the dream realm.

• **Conflict:** They frequently disrupt guild missions, sabotage [Driftway](Driftways.md) mapping efforts, and interfere with dreamwalker operations.

• **Philosophical Divide:** While the guild sees its role as protective, the Unwoven believe it undermines the natural balance and freedom of the dream realm.

• **Minority Movement:** Despite their vocal opposition, the Unwoven represent only a small fraction of [[Dreamkind]]. Most [[Dreamkind]] either appreciate the guild’s protective efforts or remain indifferent.

**Tactics and Organization**

The Unwoven operate as a loosely organized faction with no formal leadership, united by shared ideals rather than hierarchical structure.

• **Guerrilla Actions:** They use sabotage, misdirection, and disruption to weaken the guild’s influence.

• **Rallying Lesser [[Dreamkind]]:** Autonomous [[Dreamkind]] often sway less-aware [[Dreamkind]] to join their cause, though these recruits are typically used as distractions or tools in their conflicts.

• **Independent Cells:** Unwoven members act in small, scattered groups, pursuing their objectives independently.

**Impact on the Dreamscape**

The Unwoven’s actions create instability in the dreamscape, often leading to unintended consequences that affect both [[Dreamkind]] and dreamwalkers.

• **Disrupted [[Driftways]]:** Their sabotage of [[Driftways]] can create hazards, making dream travel unpredictable and dangerous.

• **Strained Relations:** Their resistance heightens tensions between [[Dreamkind]] and the guild, complicating the guild’s mission.

• **Philosophical Ripples:** Their rebellion sparks debates about the guild’s role and the rights of [[Dreamkind]], even among those who don’t support the Unwoven.
