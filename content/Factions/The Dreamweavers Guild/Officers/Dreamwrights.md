**Role:** Guild Strategists and Planners

**Status:** Overseers of Dreamscape Operations

Dreamwrights are senior members of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] responsible for overseeing its daily operations and long-term strategies. Acting as the bridge between [[The Restless]] and the guild’s operatives, they manage resources, assign missions, and provide the vital infrastructure needed for safe and effective dreamwalking. While they rarely dreamwalk on missions themselves, their expertise and guidance shape the success of the guild’s endeavors in both the dreamscape and the waking world.

**Core Responsibilities**

Dreamwrights hold a wide range of duties that ensure the guild’s operations remain organized, efficient, and secure:

• **Managing Dream Teams:** Dreamwrights assign teams to missions, pairing operatives based on their unique skills and the mission’s demands. They act as mentors, strategists, and coordinators, ensuring that each mission aligns with the guild’s overarching goals.

• **Mapping the Dreamscape:** A critical responsibility of Dreamwrights is cataloging and maintaining the guild’s maps of the dreamscape. They document Driftways—natural pathways between dreams—reported by [dream teams](Dream%20Teams.md). These maps are kept highly secret to prevent misuse and ensure that the guild maintains control over dream traversal.

• **Analyzing Threats:** Dreamwrights study reports from [dream teams](Dream%20Teams.md) and Sleep Talkers, tracking malevolent forces, patterns of disturbance, and areas of interest within the dream realm. This intelligence guides future missions and helps the guild anticipate emerging threats.

• **Balancing Realms:** Dreamwrights ensure that the guild’s focus remains balanced between the dreamscape and the waking world, coordinating efforts to address threats that span both realms. 

**Mapping and Driftways**

[[Driftways]]—natural phenomena that allow travel between dreams—are central to the Dreamwrights’ work. While they do not personally discover these connections, they analyze reports from [dream teams](Dream%20Teams.md) and ensure these pathways are properly mapped and cataloged.

This mapping serves multiple purposes:

• **Safe Navigation:** Providing [dream teams](Dream%20Teams.md) with precise routes to navigate the dreamscape efficiently.

• **Secrecy and Protection:** Ensuring [Driftway](Driftways.md) maps are safeguarded to prevent malevolent forces from exploiting them.

• **Strategic Planning:** Using the interconnected nature of dreams to plan missions that require swift and coordinated movement across the dreamscape.

Dreamwrights must also decide whether a discovered Driftway should be monitored, avoided, or actively utilized, based on its strategic value and associated risks.

**Former Dreamwalkers**

Most Dreamwrights are seasoned operatives who previously served on [dream teams](Dream%20Teams.md). Their firsthand experience with the dangers of the dreamscape equips them to mentor younger operatives and make informed decisions. Although they seldom undertake active missions, they remain skilled dreamwalkers and may occasionally enter the dream realm for critical purposes, such as observing significant events or assisting with high-stakes operations.

**The Dreamwright Council**

Dreamwrights convene regularly in the dreamscape itself, using shared dreaming rituals to hold council meetings within a neutral, collaborative dreamspace. This allows them to bypass the limitations of waking-world coordination and tackle multiple strategic issues simultaneously. The council reviews mission outcomes, discusses emerging threats, and sets long-term priorities for the guild.

**Presence and Influence**

Dreamwrights are respected for their knowledge, experience, and strategic acumen. They are the trusted lieutenants of [[The Restless]], translating his vision into actionable plans and ensuring the guild functions as a cohesive unit.

**Significance to the Guild**

Dreamwrights are the backbone of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]], providing the structure and strategy needed to protect the dreamscape. Their work ensures that every [dream team](Dream%20Teams.md) mission, Driftway mapping project, and waking-world operation is carried out with precision and purpose.

By balancing logistics, intelligence, and field operations, Dreamwrights uphold the guild’s mission and secure its legacy as guardians of the dream realm. They are the unseen architects of the guild’s success, weaving together the threads of dreams and reality to form a tapestry of vigilance and protection.
