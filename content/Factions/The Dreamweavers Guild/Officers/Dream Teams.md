**Role:** Operatives in the Dream and Waking Worlds

**Status:** The Frontline of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]]

Dream Teams are the primary operatives of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]], tasked with infiltrating, influencing, and policing the dream realm. They are also responsible for missions in the waking world, as many forces that threaten dreamers have a dual existence across planes. These highly trained groups work together to confront malevolent entities, protect dreamers, and maintain the delicate balance of both the dreamscape and reality. Their missions demand exceptional teamwork, lucid dreaming expertise, and adaptability in navigating the interconnected dangers of the dream and waking worlds.

**Composition and Structure**

A Dream Team is composed of skilled operatives, each bringing unique talents and abilities to the group. Every team relies on:

• **Lucid Dreamwalkers:** Operatives trained to achieve and sustain lucidity, enabling them to manipulate the dreamscape, gain enhanced abilities, and confront threats with precision.

• **Versatile Operatives:** Team members equally adept in the waking world, capable of combat, diplomacy, or reconnaissance when missions extend beyond the dreamscape.

• **Support from a Sleep Talker:** Though not physically present in the dreamscape, the assigned [Sleep Talker](Sleep%20Talkers.md) acts as the team’s mission manager, monitoring their progress, providing observational insights, and safeguarding their sleeping bodies in the waking world.
  
**The Role of Lucidity**

Lucidity is the cornerstone of a Dream Team’s effectiveness. Achieving lucidity allows a dreamwalker to control their presence in the dream, enhancing their abilities and perception. A Dream Team’s greatest strength lies in their ability to achieve synchronized lucidity.

When one member becomes lucid, they can attempt to bring their companions into lucidity as well. This process requires precision, as there is always a risk of inadvertently causing a dreamwalker to wake, which could jeopardize the mission. However, with multiple lucid dreamers, the team’s mission awareness and collective power increase dramatically, improving their chances of success.

**Dual Realms of Operation**

Dream Teams operate across both the dreamscape and the waking world, often needing to navigate between the two within a single mission. Forces that threaten dreamers frequently have physical manifestations or influences in the waking world, requiring Dream Teams to remain versatile and capable in both realms.

Some examples of dual-realm missions include:

• **Tracking Malevolent Entities:** Pursuing a threat through the dream realm and identifying its waking counterpart to neutralize it fully.

• **Defending Dreamers:** Protecting a target in the waking world while simultaneously working within their dreams to confront invasive forces.

• **Reconnaissance and Intervention:** Gathering intelligence in the waking world to understand a threat, then entering the dreamscape to confront it directly.

**Mission Types**

Dream Teams are deployed for various critical tasks, including:

• **Infiltration:** Entering dreams or waking locations to investigate disturbances or locate malevolent forces.

• **Intervention:** Neutralizing threats, rescuing endangered dreamers, or preventing exploitation of either realm.

• **Mapping and Reporting:** Discovering and documenting Driftways in the dreamscape or anomalies in the waking world.

• **Surveillance:** Monitoring dreams, individuals, or entities suspected of disrupting the balance between the two planes.

**Operational Challenges**

Dream Teams face dangers across both realms:

• **Malevolent Entities:** Hostile forces within the dream realm or their waking counterparts seek to harm dreamers or destabilize the balance.

• **Shifting Dreamscapes:** The unpredictable nature of dreams demands adaptability and constant vigilance.

• **Waking Threats:** Physical dangers to the team’s sleeping bodies or external obstacles in the waking world require strategic planning and protection.

**Significance to the Guild**

Dream Teams are the heart of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]], embodying its mission to protect and preserve the balance between the dreamscape and the waking world. Their ability to seamlessly navigate both realms makes them indispensable in confronting the multifaceted threats that dreamers face.

By bridging the dream and waking worlds, Dream Teams ensure that the guild’s knowledge and resources translate into decisive action, safeguarding both realms with equal precision. They are the guild’s frontline, carrying its mission into the vast unknowns of consciousness and reality alike.
