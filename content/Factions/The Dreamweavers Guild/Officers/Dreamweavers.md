**Role**: Artisans of the Dreamweaving Tradition

**Status**: Rare and Indispensable

Dreamweavers are the women entrusted with the ancient and mystical art of creating dream catchers, an indispensable craft that forms the foundation of the Dreamweavers Guild. They are the keepers of a closely guarded tradition, passed down through generations, and their work enables the guild to function as it does today. Without the Dreamweavers, the guild would lack the ability to carry out coordinated dreamwalking operations, making them vital to its mission of protecting the dream realm.

#### Guardians of a Sacred Craft:

Dreamweavers possess a rare and specialized knowledge of the dream realm, allowing them to weave dream catchers infused with potent magic. Their craft requires not only dexterity and precision but also a deep understanding of the subtle energies that govern the dreamscape. Few are chosen to become Dreamweavers, and fewer still master the intricate skills required, making them a small but invaluable part of the guild.

#### Advisors and Visionaries:

Beyond their craftsmanship, Dreamweavers often serve as advisors to guild leaders, including The Restless. Their insights into the dream realm and its complexities are highly sought after. They are revered figures within the guild, and their words carry great weight.

#### The Weavers’ Legacy:

It was the first Dreamweavers who revolutionized dreamwalking with the invention of the dream catcher, a tool that turned isolated efforts into coordinated team operations. This innovation not only solidified the guild’s place as protectors of the dream realm but also made the impossible—shared lucid dreaming—a reality.

Dreamweavers rarely enter the dream realm themselves, dedicating their lives to perfecting their craft and passing on their knowledge to the next generation. Their work is a testament to the guild’s enduring mission, and their legacy ensures that dreamwalking remains both possible and effective.
