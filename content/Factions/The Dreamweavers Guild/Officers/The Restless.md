**Position**: Leader of the Dreamweavers Guild

**Status**: Revered and Solemn

The Restless serves as the ultimate leader of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]], a position regarded with profound respect and solemnity due to the immense sacrifice it demands. The title “The Restless” is not symbolic but literal—upon taking on the role, the leader undergoes a ritual that severs their ties to the dream realm. This ensures they are entirely removed from active dreamwalking activities and eliminates the risk of abusing the guild’s resources or power for personal gain.

#### The Great Sacrifice:

In exchange for this detachment, The Restless pays a heavy price: they lose the ability to sleep. While this grants them immunity to the allure or corruption of dreams, it also condemns them to a life of perpetual wakefulness. Unlike ordinary sleeplessness, The Restless does not suffer mental degradation or madness, as the ritual fortifies their mind. However, their body endures the slow erosion of vitality, leading to a significantly shortened lifespan. The weight of their fatigue is ever-present, manifesting in their weary demeanor and the deep lines etched into their face.

#### A Shield Against Malevolence:

The severance from the dream realm also renders The Restless immune to its many dangers, including the influence of malevolent forces that prey on the sleeping and the dreamwalkers who enter their domain. This immunity protects not only the individual leader but also the guild itself, as The Restless becomes an incorruptible anchor. No nightmare-born entity can manipulate, tempt, or control them, allowing them to guide the guild with clarity and steadfast resolve.

#### A Symbol of Devotion:

Only someone deeply committed to the guild’s cause would accept this role. The Restless embodies the guild’s ideals of selflessness, vigilance, and sacrifice. They are a beacon of integrity, standing apart from the allure and temptations of the dreamscape to ensure fairness and accountability. Their constant state of exhaustion serves as a reminder of their unending dedication to protecting the dreamers and maintaining balance within the dream realm.

#### Responsibilities:

Though removed from direct dreamwalking, The Restless oversees the guild’s operations, arbitrates disputes, and serves as the final authority on policy and ethics. They are the guild’s anchor, guiding its members with wisdom honed by clarity of purpose and unclouded by personal involvement in the dream realm.

**Appearance and Presence:**

The Restless is a figure of quiet gravity, their eyes shadowed but sharp, reflecting both exhaustion and unwavering resolve. Their speech is measured, their presence commanding respect. While they do not wield power in the dream realm, their decisions ripple through it, shaping the guild’s mission and maintaining its integrity.

To serve as The Restless is to live a life of unparalleled sacrifice, a testament to the guild’s ideals and an enduring symbol of its commitment to the safety of dreamers. In doing so, The Restless becomes both a shield against corruption and a compass guiding [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] toward its noble purpose.
