**Type:** Secretive Interplanar Organization

**Purpose:** Guardians of the Dreamscape

The Dreamweavers Guild is a clandestine organization dedicated to protecting the dreamscape—a mysterious plane of existence intricately tied to the consciousness of people and creatures. Operating in both the dream realm and the waking world, the guild confronts threats that span the boundaries of reality and [dreams](Dreams.md). Its work is rooted in secrecy, ensuring its knowledge and resources remain safeguarded from those who would exploit the dream realm for personal gain.

**Mission and Philosophy**

The guild’s mission is to ensure the safety and balance of the dreamscape. Its operatives—dreamwalkers, Dreamwrights, Sleep Talkers, and other specialized members—work together to:

• **Protect Dreamers:** Safeguarding individuals from the influence of malevolent entities and forces.

• **Police the Dreamscape:** Neutralizing threats, monitoring activity, and preventing the misuse of dream-related phenomena, such as Driftways.

• **Preserve the Balance:** Maintaining the delicate relationship between the dream realm and the waking world, preventing disruptions that could ripple across both planes.

At its core, the guild embodies a philosophy of vigilance, sacrifice, and respect for the mysteries of the dreamscape.

**Secrecy and Structure**

The Dreamweavers Guild operates in utmost secrecy. Its existence is unknown to the general population, and even among its members, knowledge is compartmentalized to protect its inner workings. This secrecy is essential to prevent the guild’s discoveries—such as the mapping of Driftways or the mechanics of shared lucid dreaming—from being exploited by external forces or corrupted by greed.

The guild is structured to balance autonomy and coordination:

• **[[The Restless]]:** The guild’s leader, who sacrifices sleep and a portion of their lifespan to ensure impartial leadership.

• **[[Dreamwrights]]:** Senior operatives responsible for strategy, mission oversight, and mapping the dream realm.

• **[[Dream Teams]]:** The guild’s frontline operatives, tasked with missions in the dreamscape and the waking world.

• **[[Sleep Talkers]]:** Mission managers who act as the eyes and ears of dream teams, providing support from a half-awake state.

**Operations and Activities**

The guild’s activities span both the dream realm and the waking world, with missions often requiring operatives to navigate between the two. These operations include:

• **Dreamwalking Missions:** Entering the [dreams](Dreams.md) of others to combat threats, investigate anomalies, or influence outcomes.

• **Waking World Interventions:** Addressing threats that manifest physically, such as individuals or groups exploiting dream-based phenomena.

• **Driftway Mapping:** Documenting the natural pathways that connect [dreams](Dreams.md), ensuring safe traversal and preventing misuse.

• **Dream Catcher Crafting:** The creation and maintenance of dream catchers, the artifacts that enable shared dreaming and team-based missions.

**The Dreamscape’s Mysteries**

Despite their expertise, the Dreamweavers Guild has only scratched the surface of understanding the dreamscape. The persistent and interconnected nature of dreams hints at a deeper, enigmatic truth about the plane’s origins. The guild does not know if dreamers create the dreamscape or are merely transported there, but they recognize its vital role in consciousness and reality.

**A Legacy of Sacrifice and Vigilance**

The Dreamweavers Guild’s history is marked by the sacrifices of its members, who dedicate their lives to protecting a realm that most will never know exists. From the tireless leadership of [[The Restless]] to the frontline bravery of dream teams, every member contributes to the guild’s enduring mission.

Operating in shadows, the Dreamweavers Guild is the invisible guardian of a fragile balance between the dreamscape and the waking world, ensuring that the mysteries of [dreams](Dreams.md) remain protected from those who would seek to unravel or exploit them.
