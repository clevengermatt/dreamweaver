**Type:** Universal Dream Realm Practice

**Purpose:** Navigating and Influencing the Dream Realm

Dreamwalking refers to the act of engaging with dreams, usually with a degree of awareness or intent. While technically anyone who dreams could be said to be dreamwalking, the term is typically reserved for those who possess a measure of command within the dream realm. For trained individuals, dreamwalking involves consciously navigating the dreamscape, achieving lucidity, and influencing dreams to achieve specific goals. 

**Definition and Purpose**

Dreamwalking is not a strict term; it generally implies dreaming with a greater sense of control or purpose. While untrained dreamers passively experience their dreams, dreamwalkers actively engage with the dreamscape, often striving to achieve lucidity—the state of realizing they are dreaming—and using that awareness to interact with the dream world.

Dreamwalking serves a variety of purposes:

• **Exploration:** Understanding and navigating the dream realm.

• **Protection:** Safeguarding dreamers from malevolent forces.

• **Influence:** Guiding dreams for therapeutic or practical purposes.

**The Process of Dreamwalking**

Trained dreamwalkers do not typically enter dreams in a lucid state. Instead, they:

• **Fall Asleep Naturally:** Like any dreamer, they first enter a non-lucid state.

• **Achieve Lucidity:** Skilled dreamwalkers can quickly and consistently recognize they are dreaming, using techniques and mental exercises to awaken their awareness.

• **Navigate the Dreamscape:** Once lucid, they interact with the dream realm intentionally, using their knowledge of its mechanics, such as Driftways, to traverse or influence dreams.

Master dreamwalkers are highly proficient at achieving lucidity and interacting effectively with the dreamscape’s complex and fluid nature.

**Challenges of Dreamwalking**

The dream realm is unpredictable and fraught with challenges:

• **Lucidity:** Achieving and maintaining lucidity is a skill that requires discipline and practice.

• **Shifting Dreamscapes:** Dreams are fluid, and their environments can change abruptly, disorienting the dreamwalker.

• **Malevolent Forces:** The dream realm contains dangers, from hostile Dreamkind to the subconscious fears of the dreamer.

**Driftways and Dreamwalking**

Driftways, the natural passages between dreams, are an essential part of advanced dreamwalking. Recognizing and utilizing Driftways safely requires experience and understanding, as they are critical for traversing the dreamscape without becoming lost or destabilizing the environment.

**Independent vs. Guild Dreamwalkers**

Dreamwalking is not exclusive to the Dreamweavers Guild. While the guild trains its operatives to use dreamwalking for protective and policing purposes, independent dreamwalkers often engage in it for personal or practical reasons. However, untrained dreamwalkers face greater risks and are less equipped to handle the complexities of the dreamscape.

**Significance**

Dreamwalking bridges the gap between the waking world and the dream realm. It is an art, a skill, and a challenge, offering opportunities to explore the unknown, confront dangers, and influence the subconscious. Whether performed by guild operatives or independent dreamers, dreamwalking reflects humanity’s profound connection to the mysterious realm of dreams.
