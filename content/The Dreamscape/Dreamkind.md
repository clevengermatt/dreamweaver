**Type:** Entities Native to the Dream Realm

**Existence:** Subconscious Manifestations of Dreamers

Dreamkind, also known as Dreamkin or Dreamborn, are entities that originate within the dream realm. They are born of the subconscious, shaped by the emotions, memories, and archetypes of dreamers from the waking world. While most Dreamkind are ephemeral and fade with the dreamscapes that create them, some persist and develop into complex beings, raising profound questions about the dream realm’s mysteries and the nature of existence.

**Nature and Origins**

The origins of Dreamkind remain one of the dreamscape’s great enigmas. They are typically shaped by the subconscious of dreamers, influenced by:

• **Emotional Echoes:** Manifestations of powerful feelings, such as love, fear, or anger.

• **Memory Fragments:** Representations of people, places, or events embedded in the dreamer’s subconscious.

• **Archetypal Figures:** Embodiments of symbolic roles, such as guides, protectors, or adversaries.

While many Dreamkind are transient, dissolving when a dream ends, others achieve persistence, becoming permanent residents of the dream realm. These enduring Dreamkind evolve beyond their origins, developing unique personalities, motivations, and even alliances.

**Autonomous Dreamkind**

Among Dreamkind, there exists a distinct category recognized as autonomous and self-aware individuals. These beings are revered by [[[The Dreamweavers Guild]]]and other dreamwalkers as equal to waking-world people in complexity and autonomy.

**Traits of Autonomous Dreamkind:**

• **Self-Awareness:** They know they exist within the dream realm and are conscious of their interactions with it.

• **Recognition of Dreamwalkers:** They understand the presence and role of dreamwalkers, often choosing to help, hinder, or remain neutral.

• **Individual Agency:** They make decisions based on their own values, goals, and perceptions, independent of any dreamer’s influence.

• **Emotional Depth:** They exhibit fully realized emotions and motivations, often indistinguishable from waking-world individuals.

This autonomy makes them capable of forming alliances, enacting complex schemes, or opposing dreamwalkers in ways that other Dreamkind cannot.

**Relationship with Dreamwalkers**

Autonomous Dreamkind are treated with the same respect and reverence as waking-world individuals, raising philosophical questions about identity, morality, and the nature of existence.

**Interactions:**

• **Allies:** They may assist dreamwalkers by offering guidance, resources, or protection, often for reasons tied to their own goals.

• **Adversaries:** Some view dreamwalkers as threats or intruders, actively working against them to preserve their own interests.

• **Neutral Observers:** Others remain indifferent, choosing to observe rather than engage.

These interactions are unpredictable, making autonomous Dreamkind both an opportunity and a challenge for dreamwalkers.

**Other Categories of Dreamkind**

Not all Dreamkind exhibit autonomy. Many remain limited in awareness and function:

• **Unconscious Echoes:** Entities that repeat symbolic or emotional tasks within a dream, unaware of the dreamscape or themselves.

• **Lucid Constructs:** Semi-aware beings that can react to dreamwalkers but lack the depth of autonomous Dreamkind.

**Significance in the Dream Realm**

Dreamkind embody the infinite creativity and complexity of the dreamscape. The existence of autonomous Dreamkind blurs the line between dream and reality, raising profound questions about the dreamscape’s purpose and its connection to consciousness.

For [[The Dreamweavers Guild]], navigating relationships with Dreamkind is critical to their work. These entities can be powerful allies, formidable foes, or neutral forces that influence the outcome of missions. Autonomous Dreamkind, in particular, challenge dreamwalkers to respect the dream realm as more than a transient space, treating its inhabitants with the same care they would afford individuals in the waking world.

Dreamkind represent the heart of the dreamscape’s mystery—a balance of wonder, danger, and philosophical depth.
