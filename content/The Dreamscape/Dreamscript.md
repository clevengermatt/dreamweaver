Dreamscript is the written language of the dreamscape, a unique and mysterious script that appears nonsensical to the untrained eye. Its symbols shift and flow, often reflecting the dreamer’s subconscious or the underlying nature of the dream itself.

**Nature of Dreamscript**

• **Automatic Transformation:** Any attempt to write in the dreamscape, regardless of the intended language, will automatically transform into Dreamscript. This phenomenon makes it the only written language in the dream realm.

• **Fluidity:** The symbols of Dreamscript often change slightly depending on the dream’s context, but its fundamental structure remains consistent enough for trained dreamwalkers to decipher.

**Learning Dreamscript**

Understanding Dreamscript is a critical skill for dreamwalkers. Members of [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] undergo rigorous training to decode its symbols, as the language often holds vital information, such as:

• Instructions left by other dreamwalkers.

• Clues hidden within the dream itself.

• Warnings or messages embedded by the subconscious.

**Dreamscript in Practice**

• **Unreadable to the Untrained:** To the average dreamer, Dreamscript appears as jumbled nonsense, reinforcing the common belief that “you can’t read in a dream.”

• **Use by the Dreamweavers Guild:** [[Dreamwrights]] and experienced dreamwalkers frequently use Dreamscript to mark pathways, [[Driftways]], and other critical dreamscape elements.

• **Connection to the Dreamscape:** Some scholars speculate that Dreamscript is a natural manifestation of the dreamscape’s essence, acting as a bridge between conscious thought and the dream realm’s deeper mysteries.

**Relationship to Spoken Language**

While Dreamscript is unique to the dreamscape, spoken languages remain consistent between the waking world and the dream realm. A dreamwalker might hear and understand spoken words as they would in the waking world, but written text will always be rendered in Dreamscript.

Dreamscript remains one of the many fascinating mysteries of the dream realm, a language shaped by the subconscious and essential to navigating the surreal and unpredictable landscapes of dreams.
