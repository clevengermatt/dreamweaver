**Type:** Dream Phenomenon

**Role in the Dreamscape:** Ominous and Mysterious

In the dream realm, sand is an enigmatic presence, steeped in foreboding and superstition among [[The Dreamweavers Guild]]. While sand sometimes exists naturally within dreams as part of their environment, its appearance in uncharacteristic places is almost never benign.[[Dream teams]] who encounter sand outside its expected context treat it as a dire warning, often choosing to abort missions or retreat to safer ground.

**Nature of Sand in Dreams**

Sand manifests in many forms—drifting grains, swirling dunes, or even cascades spilling from impossible sources. Its presence can feel strangely invasive, subtly overtaking a dreamscape as if drawn by an unseen force. Sand often appears in places where it should not logically exist:

• A pristine marble floor dusted with sand.

• A dense forest where grains seep from tree trunks.

• A library where sand spills endlessly from open books.

Such occurrences evoke unease, even among seasoned dreamwalkers, and are often considered a precursor to failure or catastrophe.

**A Warning to Dream Teams**

The guild has no definitive explanation for the nature of sand in dreams, but its reputation as an ill omen is widely acknowledged. Encounters with sand have been linked to mission failures, abrupt disruptions of [[Driftways]], and inexplicable dangers. [[Dream teams]] are advised to take sand as a warning sign, signaling instability within the dreamscape or the presence of forces beyond their understanding.

**Theories and Speculation**

Though no consensus exists, many theories attempt to explain the sand phenomenon:

• **A Natural Dream Defense:** Some believe sand represents the dream realm’s way of protecting itself, forcing intruders to leave when boundaries are pushed too far.

• **An Unseen Entity’s Influence:** Others speculate that sand is the work of a powerful dream entity, subtly guiding or obstructing dreamwalkers for unknown reasons.

• **A Sign of Collapse:** A few [[Dreamwrights]] theorize that sand signals the imminent collapse of dreamscapes or [[Driftways]], urging dreamwalkers to withdraw before they are trapped.

Whatever its origin, sand remains one of the dreamscape’s most cryptic and feared phenomena.

**Guild Protocol**

[[Dream teams]] encountering uncharacteristic sand are encouraged to:

1. **Evaluate the Dreamscape:** Determine whether the sand is part of the dream’s natural setting or an anomaly.

2. **Document the Encounter:** Record as much as possible about its behavior, location, and effects on the dreamscape.

3. **Consider Retreat:** If the sand spreads or exhibits unnatural qualities, the team should prioritize safety and disengage from the mission.

**A Persistent Mystery**

To this day, [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] has no definitive answers regarding the sand’s true nature or purpose. Its appearance is both a challenge and a reminder that the dreamscape holds secrets far beyond the guild’s grasp.

The sand is a silent presence, a harbinger of hidden dangers, and a testament to the dreamscape’s unyielding mystery. For those who walk its paths, it is a warning that not all dreams can—or should—be understood.
