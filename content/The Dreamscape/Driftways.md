**Artifact Type:** Natural Dream Transitions

**Purpose:** Movement Between Dreams

Driftways are natural and spontaneous phenomena within the dream realm, forming where the boundaries between dreams grow thin. These elusive pathways allow dream walkers to pass from one dream to another, facilitating exploration, mission success, and the interconnected nature of the dreamscape. Their mysterious origins make them integral to the Dreamweavers Guild’s operations while demanding careful stewardship to prevent misuse.

**Nature and Appearance:**

Driftways manifest in countless forms, blending seamlessly into their surroundings and often reflecting the subconscious themes of the dreams they inhabit. Some examples include:

• **A Ripple in a Pond:** Submerge into the waters and rise in another dreamer’s sea.

• **A Foggy Archway:** Walk through the mist into a different subconscious space.

• **A Winding Staircase:** Climb into the unknown and emerge somewhere else entirely.

• **A Mirror’s Surface:** Step through your reflection into another dream’s world.

• **A Tunnel of Light:** Enter the glow to transition between realms.

  

Driftways are entirely natural and cannot be artificially created or destroyed, but their discovery and mapping are pivotal for the guild’s control over dream traversal.

  

**Discovery and Reporting:**

Driftways are typically uncovered by dream teams during their missions. These teams are trained to identify the subtle signs of a Driftway and evaluate its potential for future use. Once identified, the dream team’s primary responsibilities are to:

1. **Report the Driftway** to the guild for further study and mapping.

2. **Document its Features** as thoroughly as possible, including its form and perceived destination.

  

While Driftways cannot be destroyed, they may be left unused or abandoned if deemed too dangerous or impractical.

  

**Mapping and Secrecy:**

After a Driftway is reported, Dreamwrights take over, meticulously charting its location and characteristics. These maps are considered highly classified and are accessible only to trusted guild members. This secrecy is vital for ensuring that Driftways are not exploited by malevolent forces or unauthorized individuals, maintaining the guild’s strategic advantage within the dream realm.

  

**Strategic Use:**

Mapped Driftways are essential tools for the Dreamweavers Guild, providing dream teams with secure and efficient routes through the dreamscape. Their use is carefully coordinated to avoid overexposure or unnecessary risk. Some Driftways remain dormant for years, waiting for the right moment when their unique placement becomes a critical asset.

  

**A Symbol of the Dream Realm’s Wonders:**

Driftways are a natural marvel of the dream realm, embodying its fluidity and interconnectedness. They remind the Dreamweavers Guild of the delicate balance between utility and caution in their stewardship of the dreamscape. In a realm where so much is fleeting, Driftways are enduring markers of the endless mysteries waiting to be uncovered.
