**Type:** Persistent Subconscious Landscapes

**Role in the Dreamweavers Guild:** The Core of the Dreamscape

Dreams are the persistent and enigmatic landscapes of the dreamscape, existing as both personal expressions of consciousness and shared elements of a greater, interconnected plane. These dreamscapes are tied to the minds of their dreamers, yet their origins and nature remain one of the greatest mysteries facing [[The Dreamweavers Guild]].

**The Mystery of Dreams**

The dreamscape is a vast, semi-persistent realm that interacts with conscious and subconscious minds. Dreams exhibit a level of continuity, allowing for the mapping of Driftways and other phenomena, but their true nature remains unclear.

Some theories suggest that dreams are personal constructs, created by the subconscious, which influence the broader dreamscape. Others posit that the dreamscape exists independently, and dreamers merely visit or interact with it during sleep. Even phenomena like daydreams seem to be connected, hinting at a realm so closely tied to consciousness that its boundaries blur with waking thought.

While [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] understands the mechanics and dangers of dreams, the origins and greater nature of the dreamscape remain elusive.

**Nature and Persistence of Dreams**

Dreams are shaped by the emotions, memories, and instincts of their dreamers, resulting in highly symbolic and subjective environments. Despite their ephemeral appearance, dreams possess a level of persistence, allowing them to linger within the dreamscape even after the dreamer wakes.

• Dreams can become recurring or fixed regions of the dream realm, forming stable landscapes that remain accessible over time.

• The fluidity of dreams makes them unpredictable and dangerous, as they shift and transform based on subconscious stimuli or external interference.

• These landscapes often reflect the psyche of the dreamer while remaining interconnected with the broader dreamscape.

**Driftways and Interconnectedness**

[[Driftways]], the natural pathways connecting dreams, further reinforce the persistence and interconnected nature of the dreamscape. These hidden transitions allow dream walkers to traverse between dreamscapes, making their discovery and mapping vital to the guild. The existence of [driftways](Driftways.md) suggests that dreams are not isolated creations but part of a larger, unified plane.

**Daydreams and the Dreamscape**

Even waking imaginings, such as daydreams, appear to be part of the dreamscape. These phenomena seem to blur the line between conscious thought and the subconscious realm, suggesting a constant, underlying connection between minds and the dreamscape.

**The Guild’s Knowledge and Limitations**

While [[The Dreamweavers Guild]] has mastered the mechanics of dreamwalking and understands the dangers of the dream realm, they have only scratched the surface of the dreamscape’s true nature. Dreams, as both persistent landscapes and ephemeral experiences, serve as the foundation of their work and the gateway to deeper mysteries. For all their expertise, the dreamscape remains an uncharted frontier, filled with wonder and uncertainty.
