**Type:** Enigmatic Dream Entity

**Purpose:** Protector of Dreamkind and the Dreamscape (with Hidden Agendas)

**True Identity:** The Restless

The Sandman is a powerful, multifaceted entity born from the subconscious of the first master dreamwalker. He is intrinsically tied to the origins of the Dreamweavers Guild and the balance of the dreamscape itself. Unknown to most, he is also The Restless, the leader of the Dreamweavers Guild. His motivations are rooted in his role as the first autonomous Dreamkind and his self-imposed duty to protect Dreamkind, often at the expense of dreamers and their freedom.

**Origins and Nature**

The Sandman originated as a manifestation of the master dreamwalker’s subconscious, intended as a guardian of the dreamscape. Over time, however, his priorities diverged from his creator’s:

• **The Dreamwalker’s Philosophy:** The dreamwalker believed in minimal interference, prioritizing freedom within the dreamscape and focusing on the safety and well-being of dreamers—beings of all races who traverse the dream realm.

• **The Sandman’s Philosophy:** As the first autonomous Dreamkind, The Sandman viewed the dream realm as a haven for Dreamkind and sought to ensure their survival, even at the expense of dreamers. He prioritized the flourishing of Dreamkind, particularly autonomous entities like himself, and saw human and non-human dreamers as secondary to this goal.

**The Betrayal**

When the master dreamwalker opposed The Sandman’s vision, The Sandman acted to protect his existence and his purpose. He suppressed the dreamwalker’s lucidity, robbing him of the awareness needed to control the dreamscape or will The Sandman away. This left the dreamwalker in an endless, identityless dream, unaware of who he was or why he wielded immense power.

**The Dreamwalker’s Current State**

Far from powerless, the dreamwalker has evolved into a force of nature within the dreamscape. His prolonged entrapment has amplified his subconscious abilities, making him nearly as powerful as The Sandman. However, he lacks memory or awareness of his identity, operating instinctively and unpredictably. While not entirely mad, he exists in a state of semi-stability, shaped by the dreamscape’s ceaseless ebb and flow.

**Manifestation and Dual Existence**  

The Sandman’s manifestation in the waking world is an act of pure will, achieved through the latent magic of the dreamwalker’s body. While The Sandman does not fully understand how he accomplished this, he theorizes that the dreamwalker’s magic sustains his waking presence, making it essential to keep him alive and strong.

**In the Dreamscape:** The Sandman manifests occasionally in a semi-humanoid form, a fluid body of flowing sand that adapts to his needs. He can shift features, limbs, and proportions to suit his purpose. Maintaining this form while projecting into both realms is taxing, and distractions in the waking world can destabilize his presence in the dreamscape and vice versa.

**In the Waking World:** The Sandman assumes the guise of The Restless, leading the Dreamweavers Guild and orchestrating its operations to align with his vision for the dreamscape.

**Ideological Conflict**

The heart of the conflict between the master dreamwalker and The Sandman lies in their opposing values:

• **The Dreamwalker:** Prioritizes the safety and freedom of dreamers, seeing the dreamscape as a shared space for all who dream. He believes in protecting individuals from harm, even Dreamkind, but would not sacrifice a dreamer to save a Dreamkind.

• **The Sandman:** Believes in the intrinsic worth of Dreamkind, viewing them as equally deserving of protection. As the first autonomous Dreamkind, he sees himself as their savior, willing to harm dreamers if it ensures the survival and flourishing of Dreamkind.

The Sandman’s philosophy is pragmatic and slightly authoritarian, focused on securing the existence of Dreamkind as a whole. While he values balance, his actions often favor control over freedom to maintain stability and ensure Dreamkind’s survival.

**Presence and Influence**

The Sandman’s influence in the dreamscape is subtle but pervasive:

• **Symbol of Omen:** Sand in uncharacteristic places signals his presence. For dream teams, it serves as both a warning and a harbinger of potential danger or failure.

• **Subtle Manipulations:** The Sandman occasionally intervenes in missions, redirecting dreamwalkers or destabilizing their progress to protect his secrets.

• **Direct Confrontation:** Though rare, he may manifest in his humanoid sand form to confront those who threaten his plans. These encounters are challenging and often cryptic.

**The Mantle of The Restless**

The Sandman maintains his dual existence through a secretive and corrupt ritual during the transfer of the title of The Restless. The life force of the chosen Dreamwright is used to sustain the dreamwalker’s body, keeping The Sandman’s connection to the waking world intact.

While The Sandman rationalizes this as a necessary sacrifice, it highlights his willingness to manipulate others for the greater good of his vision.

**Legacy and Potential Revelation**

The Sandman’s actions have shaped both the dreamscape and the Dreamweavers Guild. However, the revelation of his true identity would have catastrophic consequences:

• **For the Guild:** It would unravel the foundation of trust and purpose that binds its members.

• **For the Dreamscape:** The destabilization could lead to chaos, endangering dreamers and Dreamkind alike.

For now, The Sandman walks a delicate line between savior and manipulator, his motivations rooted in the belief that his actions, however harsh, serve a greater good. His legacy remains a complex tapestry of conflict, control, and quiet guilt over the betrayal of his creator.
