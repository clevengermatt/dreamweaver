**Artifact Type**: Dreamwalking Tool

**Invented By**: The First Dreamweavers

**Purpose**: Synchronizing Dream Teams

Dream catchers are magical artifacts woven by the Dreamweavers to enable coordinated dreamwalking missions. These artifacts are the cornerstone of the Dreamweavers Guild, allowing dream walkers to enter the dream realm as a cohesive team. Without dream catchers, the guild would lose the ability to operate effectively, as shared dream spaces are essential for success.

### The Power of Connection:

When activated, a dream catcher binds the consciousness of its users, pulling them into a shared dreamscape. This connection allows “dream teams” to work together, overcoming the unpredictability of individual lucid dreaming. When one member achieves lucidity, they can alert the others, granting the entire team enhanced awareness, special abilities, and limited control over the dream. This synchronized lucidity is critical for navigating the dangers of the dream realm.

### The Risks of Lucidity:

Using a dream catcher requires precision and care. Forcing another dreamer into lucidity can be risky; if the process is mishandled, it can cause the dreamer to wake suddenly, severing the connection and potentially jeopardizing the mission. Dream teams must balance their desire for control within the dream with the need to avoid disrupting the fragile state of shared dreaming.

### A Rare and Precious Tool:

Dream catchers are crafted exclusively by the Dreamweavers, whose skills are so rare that only a handful of dream catchers exist at any given time. Each artifact is unique, woven with magical threads that resonate with the dreamer’s essence. As a result, dream catchers are treated as treasures within the guild, their loss or destruction considered a severe blow.

### A Revolutionary Invention:

The creation of the dream catcher by the first Dreamweavers marked the beginning of the Dreamweavers Guild as it exists today. This invention transformed dreamwalking into a collaborative effort, enabling the guild to face threats in the dream realm with unity and precision.

Dream catchers are more than tools—they are symbols of the guild’s ingenuity and the Dreamweavers’ enduring legacy. Their threads bind not only dreamers but also the guild itself, weaving a path toward protection and purpose within the dream realm.
