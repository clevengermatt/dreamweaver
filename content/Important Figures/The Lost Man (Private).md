**Type:** Enigmatic Dreamkind (as perceived by the Guild)

**True Identity:** The First Master Dreamwalker

**Behavior:** Chaotic, Powerful, and Unpredictable

**Overview**

The Lost Man is a mysterious figure within the dreamscape, known for his immense power and unpredictable presence. Unlike other Dreamkind, he has no “home” dream and instead appears randomly across the dream realm, often disrupting dreams with his overwhelming influence. The Dreamweavers Guild regards him as a unique anomaly: a Dreamkind who exhibits unparalleled power but lacks the autonomy typically required for such abilities.

In truth, The Lost Man is the first master dreamwalker, trapped in an endless dream by The Sandman. His inability to achieve lucidity leaves him unaware of his identity or his connection to the waking world. Over time, his subconscious has expanded, making him a force of nature within the dreamscape—an entity of extraordinary power who acts without intent or understanding.

**Behavior and Presence**

• **Unpredictable Movements:** The Lost Man appears at random, often in dreams unrelated to one another, leaving dreamers and Dreamkind alike disoriented by his presence.

• **Chaotic Influence:** His subconscious reshapes dreamscapes, introducing instability and overwhelming weaker Dreamkind. His actions often feel aimless but are deeply impactful.

• **Ambiguous Intent:** To those who encounter him, The Lost Man seems to lack motive, behaving as if driven purely by instinct.

**Origins**

The Lost Man was once the first master dreamwalker, the pioneer of dreamwalking who laid the foundation for the Dreamweavers Guild’s understanding of the dream realm. He created The Sandman as a guardian of the dreamscape, but their ideological differences grew irreconcilable:

• The dreamwalker valued the dreamscape as a space for exploration and freedom, prioritizing the well-being of dreamers.

• The Sandman, as the first autonomous Dreamkind, believed in protecting Dreamkind and exerting control over the dreamscape to preserve its balance.

When The Sandman betrayed him, the dreamwalker was stripped of his lucidity and placed into an endless dream. This ensured he could not will The Sandman out of existence, as he no longer understood he was dreaming.

**Current State**

• **Subconscious Power:** Without lucidity, The Lost Man’s subconscious operates freely, amplifying his influence over the dreamscape to levels rivaling The Sandman himself.

• **Lack of Awareness:** He no longer remembers who he is or that he is dreaming. This leaves him in a state of semi-stability, neither mad nor fully coherent.

• **Force of Nature:** His actions are instinctual and erratic, making him a destabilizing presence wherever he appears.

**The Guild’s Perspective**
  
The Dreamweavers Guild believes The Lost Man to be a unique and powerful Dreamkind, unlike any other. His lack of autonomy combined with his immense power confounds their understanding of Dreamkind hierarchy.

• **A Living Mystery:** The Guild studies The Lost Man with caution, unsure of his origins or purpose.

• **Unintentional Adversary:** While he is not overtly malevolent, his disruptive influence often complicates dream missions and threatens the stability of the dream realm.

• **Reverence and Fear:** The Guild views The Lost Man with a mix of awe and trepidation, treating him as a figure of both respect and caution.

**Significance**

The Lost Man is a tragic figure, embodying the conflict between freedom and control within the dreamscape. His existence challenges the Dreamweavers Guild’s understanding of the dream realm and its inhabitants, serving as a reminder of the dreamscape’s mysteries and the cost of betrayal.

While The Sandman works tirelessly to keep the dreamwalker’s true identity hidden, The Lost Man’s presence in the dreamscape remains a potent, chaotic force that could one day bring the truth to light.
